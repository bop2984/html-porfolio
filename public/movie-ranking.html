<h1>The Best Movies According to Bach</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie of all time. The animation is breathtaking, and the story is both whimsical and profound. Hayao Miyazaki's work is a true masterpiece that resonates with audiences of all ages.</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful story of hope and friendship. The performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are unforgettable. A must-see for any movie lover.</p>
<h3>Drive</h3>
Super beutiful movie with a great story and characters. The animation is stunning, and the music is hauntingly beautiful. A true masterpiece.
